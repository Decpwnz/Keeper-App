import React from "react";
import App from "./components/App";

//dont forget to update react and react-dom to v18+ in package.json
//npm install react-dom@latest react@latest

// ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container); // createRoot(container!) if you use TypeScript
root.render(<App tab="home" />);

//CHALLENGE:
//1. Implement the add note functionality.
//- Create a constant that keeps track of the title and content.
//- Pass the new note back to the App.
//- Add new note to an array.
//- Take array and render seperate Note components for each item.

//2. Implement the delete note functionality.
//- Callback from the Note component to trigger a delete function.
//- Use the filter function to filter out the item that needs deletion.
//- Pass a id over to the Note component, pass it back to the App when deleting.

//This is the end result you're aiming for:
